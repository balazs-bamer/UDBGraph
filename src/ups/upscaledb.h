 * @file upscaledb.h
 * @brief Include file for upscaledb embedded database
 * @author Christoph Rupp, chris@crupp.de
 * @version 2.1.13
 *
 * @mainpage
 *
 * <b>This is the commercial closed-source version of upscaledb!</b>
 *
 * This manual documents the upscaledb C API. upscaledb is a key/value database
 * that is linked directly into your application, avoiding all the overhead
 * that is related to external databases and RDBMS systems.
 *
 * This header file declares all functions and macros that are needed to use
 * upscaledb. The comments are formatted in Doxygen style and can be extracted
 * to automagically generate documentation. The documentation is also available
 * online here: <a href="http://files.upscaledb.com/documentation/html">
  http://files.upscaledb.com/documentation/html</a>.
 *
 * In addition, there's a tutorial book hosted on upscaledb.com:
 * <a href="http://http://upscaledb.com/tutorial.html">
  http://upscaledb.com/tutorial.html</a>.
 *
 * If you want to create or open Databases or Environments (a collection of
 * multiple Databases), the following functions will be interesting for you:
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_env_create</td><td>Creates an Environment</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_env_open</td><td>Opens an Environment</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_env_close</td><td>Closes an Environment</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_env_create_db</td><td>Creates a Database in an
  Environment</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_env_open_db</td><td>Opens a Database from an
  Environment</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_db_close</td><td>Closes a Database</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * To insert, lookup or delete key/value pairs, the following functions are
 * used:
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_db_insert</td><td>Inserts a key/value pair into a
  Database</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_db_find</td><td>Lookup of a key/value pair in a
  Database</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_db_erase</td><td>Erases a key/value pair from a
  Database</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * Alternatively, you can use Cursors to iterate over a Database:
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_create</td><td>Creates a new Cursor</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_find</td><td>Positions the Cursor on a key</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_insert</td><td>Inserts a new key/value pair with a
  Cursor</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_erase</td><td>Deletes the key/value pair that
  the Cursor points to</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_overwrite</td><td>Overwrites the value of the current  key</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_move</td><td>Moves the Cursor to the first, next,
  previous or last key in the Database</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_cursor_close</td><td>Closes the Cursor</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * If you want to use Transactions, then the following functions are required:
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_txn_begin</td><td>Begins a new Transaction</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_txn_commit</td><td>Commits the current
  Transaction</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_txn_abort</td><td>Aborts the current Transaction</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * upscaledb supports remote Databases. The server can be embedded
 * into your application or run standalone (see tools/upszilla for a Unix
 * daemon or Win32 service which hosts Databases). If you want to embed the
 * server then the following functions have to be used:
 * <table>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_srv_init</td><td>Initializes the server</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_srv_add_env</td><td>Adds an Environment to the
  server. The Environment with all its Databases will then be available
  remotely.</td></tr>
 * <tr><td>@ref ups_srv_close</td><td>Closes the server and frees all allocated
  resources</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * If you need help then you're always welcome to use the <a
  href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/upscaledb-user">
    mailing list</a>,
 * drop a message (chris at crupp dot de) or use the <a
  href="http://upscaledb.com/index/contact">contact form</a>.
 *
 * Have fun!

/**
 * Creates a Database Environment
 *
 * A Database Environment is a collection of Databases, which are all stored
 * in one physical file (or in-memory). The maximum number of Databases
 * depends on the page size; the default is above 600.
 *
 * Each Database in an Environment is identified by a positive 16bit
 * value (except 0 and values at or above 0xf000).
 * Databases in an Environment can be created with @ref ups_env_create_db
 * or opened with @ref ups_env_open_db.
 *
 * Specify a URL instead of a filename (i.e.
 * "ups://localhost:8080/customers.db") to access a remote upscaledb Server.
 *
 * To enable ACID Transactions, supply the flag @ref UPS_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS.
 * By default, upscaledb will use a Journal for recovering the Environment
 * and its data in case of a crash, and also to re-apply committed Transactions
 * which were not yet flushed to disk. This Journalling can be disabled
 * with the flag @ref UPS_DISABLE_RECOVERY. (It is disabled if the Environment
 * is in-memory.)
 *
 * For performance reasons the Journal does not use fsync(2) (or
 * FlushFileBuffers on Win32) to flush modified buffers to disk. Use the flag
 * @ref UPS_ENABLE_FSYNC to force the use of fsync.
 *
 * If Transactions are enabled, a journal file is written in order
 * to provide recovery if the system crashes. These journal files can be
 * compressed by supplying the parameter
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_ENABLE_JOURNAL_COMPRESSION. Values are one of
 * @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_ZLIB, @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_SNAPPY etc. See the
 * upscaledb documentation for more details. This parameter is not
 * persisted.
 *
 * Upscaledb can transparently encrypt the generated file using
 * 128bit AES in CBC mode. The transactional journal is not encrypted.
 * Encryption can be enabled by specifying @ref UPS_PARAM_ENCRYPTION_KEY
 * (see below). The identical key has to be provided in @ref ups_env_open
 * as well. Ignored for remote Environments.
 *
 * CRC32 checksums are stored when a page is flushed, and verified
 * when it is fetched from disk if the flag @ref UPS_ENABLE_CRC32 is set.
 * API functions will return @ref UPS_INTEGRITY_VIOLATED in case of failed
 * verifications. Not allowed in In-Memory Environments. This flag is not
 * persisted.
 *
 * @param env A pointer to an Environment handle
 * @param filename The filename of the Environment file. If the file already
 *      exists, it is overwritten. Can be NULL for an In-Memory
 *      Environment. Can be a URL ("ups://<hostname>:<port>/<environment>")
 *      for remote access.
 * @param flags Optional flags for opening the Environment, combined with
 *      bitwise OR. Possible flags are:
 *    <ul>
 *     <li>@ref UPS_ENABLE_FSYNC</li> Flushes all file handles after
 *      committing or aborting a Transaction using fsync(), fdatasync()
 *      or FlushFileBuffers(). This file has no effect
 *      if Transactions are disabled. Slows down performance but makes
 *      sure that all file handles and operating system caches are
 *      transferred to disk, thus providing a stronger durability.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_IN_MEMORY</li> Creates an In-Memory Environment. No
 *      file will be created, and the Database contents are lost after
 *      the Environment is closed. The @a filename parameter can
 *      be NULL. Do <b>NOT</b> specify @a cache_size other than 0.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_DISABLE_MMAP</li> Do not use memory mapped files for I/O.
 *      By default, upscaledb checks if it can use mmap,
 *      since mmap is faster than read/write. For performance
 *      reasons, this flag should not be used.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_CACHE_UNLIMITED</li> Do not limit the cache. Nearly as
 *      fast as an In-Memory Database. Not allowed in combination
 *      with a limited cache size.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS</li> Enables Transactions for this
 *      Environment.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_DISABLE_RECOVERY</li> Disables logging/recovery for this
 *      Environment.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_ENABLE_CRC32</li> Stores (and verifies) CRC32
 *      checksums. Not allowed in combination with @ref UPS_IN_MEMORY.
 *    </ul>
 *
 * @param mode File access rights for the new file. This is the @a mode
 *      parameter for creat(2). Ignored on Microsoft Windows. Default
 *      is 0644.
 * @param param An array of ups_parameter_t structures. The following
 *      parameters are available:
 *    <ul>
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_CACHE_SIZE</li> The size of the Database cache,
 *      in bytes. The default size is defined in src/config.h
 *      as @a UPS_DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE - usually 2MB
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_POSIX_FADVISE</li> Sets the "advice" for
 *      posix_fadvise(). Only on supported platforms. Allowed values are
 *      @ref UPS_POSIX_FADVICE_NORMAL (which is the default) or
 *      @ref UPS_POSIX_FADVICE_RANDOM.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_PAGE_SIZE</li> The size of a file page, in
 *      bytes. It is recommended not to change the default size. The
 *      default size depends on hardware and operating system.
 *      Page sizes must be 1024 or a multiple of 2048.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_FILE_SIZE_LIMIT</li> Sets a file size limit (in bytes).
 *      Disabled by default. Not allowed in combination with @ref UPS_IN_MEMORY.
 *      If the limit is exceeded, API functions return @ref UPS_LIMITS_REACHED.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_LOG_DIRECTORY</li> The path of the log file
 *      and the journal files; default is the same path as the database
 *      file. Ignored for remote Environments.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_NETWORK_TIMEOUT_SEC</li> Timeout (in seconds) when
 *      waiting for data from a remote server. By default, no timeout is set.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_ENABLE_JOURNAL_COMPRESSION</li> Compresses
 *      the journal files to reduce I/O. See notes above.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_PARAM_ENCRYPTION_KEY</li> The 16 byte long AES
 *      encryption key; enables AES encryption for the Environment file. Not
 *      allowed for In-Memory Environments. Ignored for remote Environments.
 *    </ul>
 *
 * @return @ref UPS_SUCCESS upon success

/**
 * Opens an existing Database Environment
 *
 * This function opens an existing Database Environment.
 *
 * A Database Environment is a collection of Databases, which are all stored
 * in one physical file (or in-memory).
 *
 * Each Database in an Environment is identified by a positive 16bit
 * value (except 0 and values at or above 0xf000).
 * Databases in an Environment can be created with @ref ups_env_create_db
 * or opened with @ref ups_env_open_db.
 *
 * Specify a URL instead of a filename (i.e.
 * "ups://localhost:8080/customers.db") to access a remote upscaledb Server.
 *
 * Also see the documentation @ref ups_env_create about Transactions, Recovery,
 * AES encryption and the use of fsync.
 *
 * If Transactions are enabled, a journal file is written in order
 * to provide recovery if the system crashes. These journal files can be
 * compressed by supplying the parameter
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_JOURNAL_COMPRESSION. Values are one of
 * @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_ZLIB, @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_SNAPPY etc. See the
 * upscaledb documentation for more details. This parameter is not
 * persisted.
 *
 * CRC32 checksums are stored when a page is flushed, and verified
 * when it is fetched from disk if the flag @ref UPS_ENABLE_CRC32 is set.
 * API functions will return @ref UPS_INTEGRITY_VIOLATED in case of failed
 * verifications. This flag is not persisted.
 *
 * @param env A valid Environment handle
 * @param filename The filename of the Environment file, or URL of a upscaledb
 *      Server
 * @param flags Optional flags for opening the Environment, combined with
 *      bitwise OR. Possible flags are:
 *    <ul>
 *     <li>@ref UPS_READ_ONLY </li> Opens the file for reading only.
 *      Operations that need write access (i.e. @ref ups_db_insert) will
 *      return @ref UPS_WRITE_PROTECTED.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_ENABLE_FSYNC</li> Flushes all file handles after
 *      committing or aborting a Transaction using fsync(), fdatasync()
 *      or FlushFileBuffers(). This file has no effect
 *      if Transactions are disabled. Slows down performance but makes
 *      sure that all file handles and operating system caches are
 *      transferred to disk, thus providing a stronger durability.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_DISABLE_MMAP </li> Do not use memory mapped files for I/O.
 *      By default, upscaledb checks if it can use mmap,
 *      since mmap is faster than read/write. For performance
 *      reasons, this flag should not be used.
 *     <li>@ref UPS_CACHE_UNLIMITED </li> Do not limit the cache. Nearly as

/**
 * Creates a new Database in a Database Environment
 *
 * An Environment can contain a (limited) amount of Databases; the exact
 * limit depends on the page size and is above 600.
 *
 * Each Database in an Environment is identified by a positive 16bit
 * value. 0 and values at or above 0xf000 are reserved.
 *
 * This function initializes the ups_db_t handle (the second parameter).
 * When the handle is no longer in use, it should be closed with
 * @ref ups_db_close. Alternatively, the Database handle is closed
 * automatically if @ref ups_env_close is called with the flag
 * @ref UPS_AUTO_CLEANUP.
 *
 * A Database can (and should) be configured and optimized for the data that
 * is inserted. The data is described through flags and parameters. upscaledb
 * differentiates between several data characteristics, and offers predefined
 * "types" to describe the keys. In general, the default key type
 * (@ref UPS_TYPE_BINARY) is slower than the other types, and
 * fixed-length binary keys (@ref UPS_TYPE_BINARY in combination with
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_KEY_SIZE) is faster than variable-length binary
 * keys. It is therefore recommended to always set the key size and record size,
 * although it is not required.
 *
 * Internally, upscaledb uses two different layouts ("default" and "pax)
 * depending on the settings specified by the user. The "default" layout
 * is enabled for variable-length keys or if duplicate keys are enabled.
 * For fixed-length keys (without duplicates) the "pax" layout is chosen.
 * The "pax" layout is more compact and usually faster.
 *
 * A word of warning regarding the use of fixed length binary keys
 * (@ref UPS_TYPE_CUSTOM or @ref UPS_TYPE_BINARY in combination with
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_KEY_SIZE): if your key size is too large, only few keys
 * will fit in a Btree node. The Btree fanout will be very high, which will
 * decrease performance. In such cases it might be better to NOT specify
 * the key size; then upscaledb will store keys as blobs if they are too large.
 *
 * See the Wiki documentation for <a href=
   "https://github.com/cruppstahl/upscaledb/wiki/Evaluating-and-Benchmarking">
 * Evaluating and Benchmarking</a> on how to test different configurations and
 * optimize for performance.
 *
 * The key type is set with @ref UPS_PARAM_KEY_TYPE and can have either
 * of the following values:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_BINARY</li> This is the default key type: a binary blob.
 *   Internally, upscaledb uses memcmp(3) for the sort order. Key size depends
 *   on @ref UPS_PARAM_KEY_SIZE and is unlimited (@ref UPS_KEY_SIZE_UNLIMITED)
 *   by default.
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_CUSTOM</li> Similar to @ref UPS_TYPE_BINARY, but
 *   uses a callback function for the sort order. This function is set
 *   with the parameter @ref UPS_PARAM_CUSTOM_COMPARE_NAME.
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_UINT8</li> Key is a 8bit (1 byte) unsigned integer
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_UINT16</li> Key is a 16bit (2 byte) unsigned integer
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_UINT32</li> Key is a 32bit (4 byte) unsigned integer
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_UINT64</li> Key is a 64bit (8 byte) unsigned integer
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_REAL32</li> Key is a 32bit (4 byte) float
 *   <li>UPS_TYPE_REAL64</li> Key is a 64bit (8 byte) double
 * </ul>
 *
 * If the key type is ommitted then @ref UPS_TYPE_BINARY is the default.
 *
 * If binary/custom keys are so big that they cannot be stored in the Btree,
 * then the full key will be stored in an overflow area, which has
 * performance implications when accessing such keys.
 *
 * In addition to the flags above, you can specify @a UPS_ENABLE_DUPLICATE_KEYS
 * to insert duplicate keys, i.e. to model 1:n or n:m relationships.
 *
 * If the size of the records is always constant, then
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_RECORD_SIZE should be used to specify this size. This allows
 * upscaledb to optimize the record storage, and small records will
 * automatically be stored in the Btree's leaf nodes instead of a separately
 * allocated blob, allowing faster access.
 * A record size of 0 is valid and suited for boolean values ("key exists"
 * vs "key doesn't exist"). The default record size is
 * @ref UPS_RECORD_SIZE_UNLIMITED.
 *
 * Records can be compressed transparently in order to reduce
 * I/O and disk space. Compression is enabled with
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_RECORD_COMPRESSION. Values are one of
 * @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_ZLIB, @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_SNAPPY etc. See the
 * upscaledb documentation for more details.
 *
 * Keys can also be compressed by setting the parameter
 * @ref UPS_PARAM_KEY_COMPRESSION. See the upscaledb documentation
 * for more details.
 *
 * In addition, *experimental* integer compression algorithms are available
 * for Databases created with the type @ref UPS_TYPE_UINT32. These
 * algorithms (@ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_UINT32_VARBYTE,
 * @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_UINT32_SIMDCOMP, @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_UINT32_GROUPVARINT,
 * @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_UINT32_STREAMVBYTE, @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_UINT32_FOR,
 * @ref UPS_COMPRESSOR_UINT32_MASKEDVBYTE (requires AVX!)) are subject to
 * change and might be removed in following versions. They only work with the
 * default page size of 16kb.
 *
 * @param env A valid Environment handle.
 * @param db A valid Database handle, which will point to the created
 *      Database. To close the handle, use @ref ups_db_close.

 *      already exists, the function will fail with
 *      @ref UPS_DATABASE_ALREADY_EXISTS. Database names from 0xf000 to

 *    bitwise OR. Possible flags are:

 *     <li>@ref UPS_RECORD_NUMBER32 </li> Creates an "auto-increment" Database.
 *      Keys in Record Number Databases are automatically assigned an
 *      incrementing 32bit value. If key->data is not NULL
 *      (and key->flags is @ref UPS_KEY_USER_ALLOC), the value of the current
 *      key is returned in @a key. If key-data is NULL and key->size is 0,

 *     <li>@ref UPS_RECORD_NUMBER64 </li> Creates an "auto-increment" Database.
 *      Keys in Record Number Databases are automatically assigned an

 * Searches an item in the Database
 *
 * This function searches the Database for @a key. If the key
 * is found, @a record will receive the record of this item and
 * @ref UPS_SUCCESS is returned. If the key is not found, the function
 * returns @ref UPS_KEY_NOT_FOUND.
 *
 * A ups_record_t structure should be initialized with
 * zeroes before it is being used. This can be done with the C library
 * routines memset(3) or bzero(2).
 *
 * If the function completes successfully, the @a record pointer is
 * initialized with the size of the record (in @a record.size) and the
 * actual record data (in @a record.data). If the record is empty,
 * @a size is 0 and @a data points to NULL.
 *
 * The @a data pointer is a temporary pointer and will be overwritten
 * by subsequent upscaledb API calls using the same Transaction
 * (or, if Transactions are disabled, using the same Database).
 * You can alter this behaviour by allocating the @a data pointer in
 * the application and setting @a record.flags to @ref UPS_RECORD_USER_ALLOC.
 * Make sure that the allocated buffer is large enough.
 *
 * When specifying @ref UPS_DIRECT_ACCESS, the @a data pointer will point
 * directly to the record that is stored in upscaledb; the data can be modified,
 * but the pointer must not be reallocated or freed. The flag @ref
 * UPS_DIRECT_ACCESS is only allowed in In-Memory Databases and not if
 * Transactions are enabled.
 *
 * @ref ups_db_find can not search for duplicate keys. If @a key has
 * multiple duplicates, only the first duplicate is returned.
 *
 * You can read only portions of the record by specifying the flag
 * @ref UPS_PARTIAL. In this case, upscaledb will read
 * <b>record->partial_size</b> bytes of the record data at offset
 * <b>record->partial_offset</b>. If necessary, the record data will
 * be limited to the original record size. The number of actually read
 * bytes is returned in <b>record->partial_size</b>. The original size of
 * the record is stored in <b>record->size</b>.
 *
 * @ref UPS_PARTIAL is not allowed if record->size is <= 8 or if Transactions
 * are enabled. In such a case, @ref UPS_INV_PARAMETER is returned.
 *
 * If Transactions are enabled (see @ref UPS_ENABLE_TRANSACTIONS) and
 * @a txn is NULL then upscaledb will create a temporary Transaction.
 * When moving the Cursor, and the new key is currently modified in an
 * active Transaction (one that is not yet committed or aborted) then
 * upscaledb will skip this key and move to the next/previous one. However if
 * @a flags are 0 (and the Cursor is not moved), and @a key or @a rec
 * is NOT NULL, then upscaledb will return error @ref UPS_TXN_CONFLICT.
 *

 * @param txn A Transaction handle, or NULL
 * @param key The key of the item
 * @param record The record of the item

 * For Approximate Matching the returned match will either match the

 * 'nearest' to the given key, when both a key above and a key below the

/**
 * Inserts a Database item and points the Cursor to the inserted item
 *
 * This function inserts a key/record pair as a new Database item.
 * If the key already exists in the Database, error @ref UPS_DUPLICATE_KEY
 * is returned.
 *
 * If you wish to overwrite an existing entry specify the
 * flag @ref UPS_OVERWRITE. The use of this flag is not allowed in combination
 * with @ref UPS_DUPLICATE.
 *
 * If you wish to insert a duplicate key specify the flag @ref UPS_DUPLICATE.
 * (In order to use duplicate keys, the Database has to be created with
 * @ref UPS_ENABLE_DUPLICATE_KEYS.)
 * By default, the duplicate key is inserted after all other duplicate keys
 * (see @ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_LAST). This behaviour can be overwritten by
 * specifying @ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_FIRST, @ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_BEFORE
 * or @ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_AFTER.
 *
 * You can write only portions of the record by specifying the flag
 * @ref UPS_PARTIAL. In this case, upscaledb will write <b>partial_size</b>
 * bytes of the record data at offset <b>partial_offset</b>. If necessary, the
 * record data will grow. Gaps will be filled with null-bytes, if the record
 * did not yet exist.
 *
 * @ref UPS_PARTIAL is not allowed if record->size is <= 8 or if Transactions
 * are enabled. In such a case, @ref UPS_INV_PARAMETER is returned.
 *
 * Specify the flag @ref UPS_HINT_APPEND if you insert sequential data
 * and the current @a key is greater than any other key in this Database.
 * In this case upscaledb will optimize the insert algorithm. upscaledb will
 * verify that this key is the greatest; if not, it will perform a normal
 * insert. This flag is the default for Record Number Databases.
 *
 * Specify the flag @ref UPS_HINT_PREPEND if you insert sequential data
 * and the current @a key is lower than any other key in this Database.
 * In this case upscaledb will optimize the insert algorithm. upscaledb will
 * verify that this key is the lowest; if not, it will perform a normal
 * insert.
 *
 * After inserting, the Cursor will point to the new item. If inserting
 * the item failed, the Cursor is not modified.
 *
 * Record Number Databases (created with @ref UPS_RECORD_NUMBER32 or
 * @ref UPS_RECORD_NUMBER64) expect either an empty @a key (with a size of
 * 0 and data pointing to NULL), or a user-supplied key (with key.flag
 * @ref UPS_KEY_USER_ALLOC and a valid data pointer).
 * If key.size is 0 and key.data is NULL, upscaledb will temporarily
 * allocate memory for key->data, which will then point to an 4-byte (or 8-byte)
 * unsigned integer.
 *
 * @param cursor A valid Cursor handle
 * @param key A valid key structure
 * @param record A valid record structure
 * @param flags Optional flags for inserting the item, combined with
 *    bitwise OR. Possible flags are:
 *    <ul>
 *    <li>@ref UPS_OVERWRITE. If the @a key already exists, the record is
 *        overwritten. Otherwise, the key is inserted. Not allowed in
 *        combination with @ref UPS_DUPLICATE.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_DUPLICATE. If the @a key already exists, a duplicate
 *        key is inserted. Same as @ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_LAST. Not
 *        allowed in combination with @ref UPS_DUPLICATE.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_BEFORE. If the @a key already exists,
 *        a duplicate key is inserted before the duplicate pointed
 *        to by the Cursor.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_AFTER. If the @a key already exists,
 *        a duplicate key is inserted after the duplicate pointed
 *        to by the Cursor.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_FIRST. If the @a key already exists,
 *        a duplicate key is inserted as the first duplicate of
 *        the current key.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_DUPLICATE_INSERT_LAST. If the @a key already exists,
 *        a duplicate key is inserted as the last duplicate of
 *        the current key.
 *    <li>@ref UPS_HINT_APPEND. Hints the upscaledb engine that the
 *        current key will compare as @e larger than any key already
 *        existing in the Database. The upscaledb engine will verify
 *        this postulation and when found not to be true, will revert
 *        to a regular insert operation as if this flag was not
 *        specified. The incurred cost then is only one additional key
 *        comparison. Mutually exclusive with flag @ref UPS_HINT_PREPEND.
 *        This is the default for Record Number Databases.
