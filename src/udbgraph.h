    must be registered in user modules to be able to created. User code must guarantee
    the constant order of registering regardless of compilation units and architecture
    in order to keep existing database consistency.

    A minimal Payload subclass definition looks like this:

    class SamplePayload : public Payload {
    protected:
        // Holds the ID assigned during GEFactory registration.
        static payloadType _staticType;

        // Here come the payload fields
        SomeType field;

    public:
        // Sets type for instance.
        SamplePayload(payloadType pt) : Payload(pt) {}

        // destructs SomeType
        ~SamplePayload() {
            // delete or whatever
        }

        // Returns the assigned ID for GEFactory.
        static payloadType id() { return _staticType; }

        // Sets the static PayloadType ID for GEFactory.
        static void setID(payloadType pt) { _staticType = pt; }

        // Used in GEFactory to create a shared_ptr holding a new class instance.
        // Here it is a Node, but may be DirEdge and UndirEdge as well.
        static shared_ptr<GraphElem> create(shared_ptr<Database> db, payloadType pt) {
            return shared_ptr<GraphElem>(new Node(db, std::unique_ptr<Payload>(new SamplePayload(pt))));
        }

        // Here come setter, getter, assignment operators, application logic etc methods

        // Writes all payload fields into the RecordChain via the supplied Converter
        // Writing order is essential for database and deserializer compatibility
        virtual void serialize(Converter &conv) {
            // statements like conv << field;
        }

        // Reads all payload fields from the RecordChain via the supplied Converter
        // Reading order is essential for database and serializer compatibility
        virtual void deserialize(Converter &conv) {
            // statements like conv >> field;
        }
    }
    // The above static field needs to be defined in a .cpp file:
    payloadType SamplePayload::_staticType;

    Registration is done like:
    SamplePayload::setID(GEFactory::reg(SamplePayload::create));

    Order of these statements are also essential. Newer, expanded versions must add
    new statements only after the old ones.

    A Node holding SamplePayload can be created using:
    shared_ptr<GraphElem> node = GEFactory::create(db, SamplePayload::id());
