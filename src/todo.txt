- Revise Doxygen docs: include exception names, document arguments and return values.

- DummpDB: output edge lists, too.

- getNeighbours/getEdges: gets a comparison object and if the matched item is free, it returns. If locked by an other transaction, throws Exception.

- Partial reading of RecordChain can be switched off: always read complete chain.

- Eliminate static stuff and make these relative to Database. This will enable
  use of databases with different design in an application.

- Utility to list / delete orphaned nodes. The applications must avoid orphaning nodes, so this is a debug tool.

-database creation and open parameters should be adjustable and presettable in cmake or in Database constructor
